## Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division - 2022 Income Prediction
#### Since 2020, humanity has been facing epic challenges. The pandemic spread division within the community, making it harder to socialize and keep the microeconomics running. Our stakeholder, [Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division](https://abd.iowa.gov/ "Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division"), has been requested a predictive model using Machine Learning in order to be prepared for possible future scenarios.

#### We must keep clear that our objective is not to design, create, and/or develop a Machine Learning model & Data Analytics to promote alcohol consumption or sales. The agreement with the stakeholder is to identify room for improvement in order to determine how to implement an agile process to reduce non-productive time caused by Quality Control checkpoints.

#### Iowa Liquor Sales Project is an exercise that is part of Coding Dojo: Data Science Bootcamp, where I'm trying to show how Industrial Engineering and Data Science would be merged when we want to improve business process/KPI performances in current Industry 4.0.

## Case Study Information
#### General Objective:
- Prepare the data for Machine Learning to predict [Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division](https://abd.iowa.gov/ "Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division") 2022 income from Class E alcohol liquor sales across licensed vendors using historical data (2019, 2020, and 2021) from Iowa [Liquor Sales](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/iowa-department-of-commerce/iowa-liquor-sales?project=lively-clover-358509 "Liquor Sales").
#### Specific Objectives:
- Set up the dataset in order to make it manageable. The [main](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy "main") dataset has 24+ million rows, which includes the sales from January 1st, 2012 to current, making it pretty hard to work with Google Colaboratory.
- Choose a Target for our predictive model.
- Report insights using Visual Exploration.
- Determine which prediction model would be used to be compared with real 2022 data in January 2023.

#### Scope:
- Our study consists of two parts. The [first](https://github.com/edleafvirtual/sales_predictions2023/blob/main/Part%20I:%20sales_prediction2023.ipynb "first") one is where we developed a visual analysis in order to understand the current situation of the sales, focused on how the visibility index could affect the sales performance.
- In [Part II](https://github.com/edleafvirtual/sales_predictions2023/blob/main/Part%20II:%20sales_prediction2023_(ML).ipynb "Part II"), we prepared our data for Machine Learning, evaluating two regression methods to predict the sales for 2023.
